## SAP HANA High-Availability Deployment on AWS


This Quick Start deploys an SAP HANA (with SUSE SLES for SAP as underlying OS) across two availability zones and configures them for high availability.

SAP HANA is an in-memory data platform from SAP SE. SAP products and applications such as SAP Business Suite, S/4HANA, SAP Business Warehouse (SAP BW), and SAP BW/4HANA rely on SAP NetWeaver. This Quick Start deploys SAP NetWeaver AS ABAP, which supports the development of ABAP-based applications for SAP HANA databases.

The Quick Start offers two deployment options:

- Deploying SAP HANA into a new virtual private cloud (VPC) that's configured for security, scalability, and high availability 
- Deploying SAP HANA into an existing VPC in your AWS account

You can also use the AWS CloudFormation templates as a starting point for your own implementation.
